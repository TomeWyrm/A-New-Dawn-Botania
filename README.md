Welcome to Tomewyrm's Botania repository.

Botania is a [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net/) mod based on adding natural magic to the game.

[Botania - A New Dawn](https://github.com/kotasc3/A-New-Dawn-Botania/) is a fork of Botania focused on removing Botania nerfs.

This is a fork of [Botania - A New Dawn](https://github.com/kotasc3/A-New-Dawn-Botania/) built around my own preferences about changes to Botania. Some things might be nerfed, some might be buffed, others might be removed, and content may be added from whole cloth.

My intention is to try and keep up with Vazkii regularly, but this forked version is really only intended to be used on my personal machine and any servers which I have control over; no support will be given, any and all issues can be closed or locked without a given reason at my personal discretion.
